This a project made for the Cavista Hackathon 2026.

CareGuard AI is a predictive health monitoring system that analyzes wearable data and daily signals to detect early signs of health decline and notify caregivers before emergencies occur.

Instead of using fixed thresholds, our AI uses a reasoning model:
It learns a user’s normal pattern
→ compares new data
→ detects unusual deviations
→ calculates a Health Stability Score

It then explains why that score changed.
So it doesn’t just monitor health.
It interprets it.

How it works:
